# variable-fonts

Variable fonts is a JavaScript slider to play around with the variable font Roboto.

## Description

A variable font is a single font that acts as many:
  all the variations of width and weight, slant, and
  other attributes can be contained in a single compressed font file.
  Through this slider, you'll be able to explore every variation of the
  fonts presented: weight is how "bold" the text is, width is how compressed the text is,
  and slant is how "italics" the text is.
